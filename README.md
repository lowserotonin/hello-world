<h1> I dont know shit, </h1>
<p>and I give up often so dont expect a damn thing.
 Im curious about how this all works so Ill just keep throwing myself
in every now and then and try to learn something new.

  <ul>
    <li>Familiarize myself with the main application</li>
    <li>Push a little more progress out each time I try</li>
    <li>Make something eventually</li>
  </ul>
